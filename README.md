# Express Note and Butter Taker

## Description

'Express Note and Butter Taker' is a note taker website application using express. The reason behind this project was to put in practice the connection between the front end and back end of coding. <br>
Using this note taker will make it easier to add daily task that can be useful to be more productive on a daily basis. <br>
By building this project, I learned how the back end compliments the front end to execute a more complete website. <br>
Even though back end applications are not seen by the public/user, it is important as a developer to see how the back end is essential to the front end.
